  # We use pull_request_target such that the code owner validation works for PRs from forks,
  # because we need repository secrets for that, which pull_request wouldn't allow from forks.
  # However, it's very important that we don't run code from forks without sandboxing it,
  # because that way anybody could potentially extract repository secrets!
  # Furthermore, using pull_request_target doesn't require manually approving first-time contributors
