# Nix organisation

This repository aims to document the organisation of official Nix resources, such as:
- Which resources are official (domains, accounts, legal entities, ...)
- Who has permission over which resources (individuals, teams, companies, ...)
- Organisational processes/policies exist (RFCs, permission requests, ...)

This repository is only the _entry-point_ for such documentation.
More detailed organisational documentation can be delegated to other resources.

The goal of this repository is to make organisation transparent, explicit, discoverable and open to change.
Anybody is welcome to open issues/PRs to add/update documentation or propose organisational changes.

For contributing see [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
