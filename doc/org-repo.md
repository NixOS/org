# Organisation repo

This repository itself is the entry point for documentation on official resources.

Everybody in the [CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS) file has write permission to this repository.
This allows people to get automatic review requests and merge PRs for the files that concern them.
PRs can only be merged if a codeowner for the respective files approves it, and all files need to have a codeowner entry.

Furthermore, the code owners for the CODEOWNERS file should have permission to give more people write access to this repository.
These people get requested for reviews when new people add themselves to CODEOWNERS, allowing them to give write access when merged.

Every member of the steering committee has the right to merge a PR in the repository.
The person who merges is responsible for doing so with due care.
