# GitHub

The [NixOS GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nixos) and all its repositories is part of the [official resources](./resources.md).

A very small number of people are owners of this GitHub Organisation, and have ultimate permissions over it:
- [@domenkozar](https://github.com/domenkozar)
- [@edolstra](https://github.com/edolstra)
- [@garbas](https://github.com/garbas)
- [@zimbatm](https://github.com/zimbatm)

Furthermore, there is an interim owner to help out:
- [@lassulus](https://github.com/lassulus)

This interim owner is responsible for receiving requests to change anything about the GitHub organisation in the [Github org owners help desk Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#org_owners:nixos.org), and either acting upon them or forwarding them to the right person.


## Repositories

There are many repositories, but these are some of the most important ones.

### [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/)

The Nix package collection and NixOS.

Over 200 people have commit access, which is managed by the Nixpkgs committer delegation team, whose processes are described [here](./nixpkgs-committers.md) and consists of these people:
- @Mic92
- @NickCao
- @jtojnar

Furthermore, every [Nixpkgs maintainer](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/maintainers) is part of the organisation, such that they can be requested as a reviewer.

Being a Nixpkgs maintainer doesn't grant any permissions by itself.
They can however make use of the [Nixpkgs merge bot](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-merge-bot) in certain cases.
