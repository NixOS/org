# GitHub

The [NixOS](https://github.com/nixos) and [NixCon](https://github.com/nixcon) GitHub organisations,
as well as all their repositories are part of the [official resources](./resources.md).

The org owners documentation is [here](./github-org-owners.md).

## Repositories

There are many repositories, but these are some of the most important ones.

### [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/)

The Nix package collection and NixOS.

Over 200 people have commit access, which is managed by the [Nixpkgs committer delegation team](./nixpkgs-committers.md).

Furthermore, every [Nixpkgs maintainer](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/maintainers) is part of the organisation, such that they can be requested as a reviewer.

Being a Nixpkgs maintainer doesn't grant any permissions by itself.
They can however make use of the [Nixpkgs merge bot](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-merge-bot) in certain cases.
