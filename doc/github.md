# GitHub

The [NixOS GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nixos) and all its repositories is part of the [official resources](./resources.md).

A very small number of people are owners of this GitHub Organisation, and have ultimate permissions over it.

Over 200 people in the organisation have permissions over only certain parts.

## Repositories

There are many repositories, but these are some of the most important ones.

### [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/)

The Nix package collection and NixOS.

There are over 200 Nixpkgs committers with access to merge any PR.
To become a Nixpkgs committer, you can apply [in this issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/50105).

Furthermore, every [Nixpkgs maintainer](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/maintainers) is part of the organisation, such that they can be requested as a reviewer.

Being a Nixpkgs maintainer doesn't grant any permissions by itself.
They can however make use of the [Nixpkgs merge bot](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-merge-bot) in certain cases.
