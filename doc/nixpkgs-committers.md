# Nixpkgs committers

There are over 200 Nixpkgs committers with access to merge any PR.

To become a Nixpkgs committer, you can apply by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-committers/issues/new/choose). (TODO: move this repository)
Committers should have their GitHub name/ID in the [maintainer-list](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/maintainer-list.nix).
This allows us to keep track of committers even if usernames are changed or accounts are deleted.

The [Nixpkgs committer admins](./github.md#nixpkgs) is given the responsibility and authority of changing the list of [Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nixpkgs-committers).

## Rules for changing the process for managing nixpkgs committer access

- The process must be publicly documented (this document)
- Any change to the process must be unanimously agreed upon by all Nixpkgs committer admins.
- Any change in the list of committers must be publicly documented and agreed upon by all Nixpkgs committer admins.
