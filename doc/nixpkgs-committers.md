# Nixpkgs committers

There are [200 Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-committers/tree/main/members) with access to merge any PR.
You can nominate yourself or another contributor to become a Nixpkgs committer.
This should be done by following [these instructions](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-committers?tab=readme-ov-file#nominations).

The [Nixpkgs core team](./nixpkgs-core.md) currently fills the role of the Nixpkgs committer delegation team and is given the responsibility and authority of changing the list of [Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nixpkgs-committers).

## Process
- The process must be publicly documented (this document)
- Any change to the process must be unanimously agreed upon by all delegation team members
- Any change in the list of committers must be publicly documented
- Addition of a committer must be agreed upon by all delegation team members
- Removal of a committer only requires agreement of a single delegation team member
