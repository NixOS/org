# Nixpkgs committers

There are [200 Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-committers/tree/main/members) with access to merge any PR.
You can nominate yourself or another contributor to become a Nixpkgs committer.
This should be done by following [these instructions](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-committers?tab=readme-ov-file#nominations).

The [Nixpkgs committer delegation team](#team) is given the responsibility and authority of changing the list of [Nixpkgs committers](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nixpkgs-committers).

## Team

Nixpkgs committer delegation team consists of these people:
<!-- Keep this list in sync with the codeowners of this file! -->
