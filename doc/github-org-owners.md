## GitHub org owners

Both the [NixOS](https://github.com/nixos) and [NixCon](https://github.com/nixcon) GitHub organisations are official.

The following people have the GitHub "owners" permissions:
<!-- Also keep this in sync with the members of @NixOS/org! -->
- [@infinisil](https://github.com/infinisil)
- [@lassulus](https://github.com/lassulus)
- [@tomberek](https://github.com/tomberek)
- [@winterqt](https://github.com/winterqt)
- [@zimbatm](https://github.com/zimbatm)

## How to contact the team
For any GitHub-related needs, you can reach out to the org owners by either:
- Pinging [@NixOS/org](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/org)
- [Creating an issue in this repository](https://github.com/NixOS/org/issues/new).
- Messaging in the [Github org owners help desk Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23org_owners:nixos.org).

### Authority and processes
This team's role is to manage and unblock users of the github.com/NixOS GitHub organization. The @NixOS/steering gives them autonomy to handle small day-to-day tasks and expects them to escalate bigger decisions.

All org owners can individually take care of implementing:
- Decisions by bodies that have the authority to make GitHub org changes such as:
  - Arbitrary decisions by the Steering Committee.
  - Moderation decisions by the moderation team.
  - Changes from approved RFCs.
- Low-impact changes, such as:
  - Adding new org members to allow review requests.
  - Creating new unprivileged Nixpkgs teams for mention.
  - Updating repository meta information.
- Changes requested by a repository admin that have no impact outside their repository.

Org owners need approval from at least one other org owner to take care of implementing
higher-impact changes that are _not controversial_, such as:
- Administer unmaintained repos, such as:
  - Performing maintenance.
  - Giving commit access to trusted people that offer maintenance.
  - Archiving if appropriate.
- Changes necessary to unblock automation.
- Changes to the structure and CI of the [org repository](https://github.com/NixOS/org).
- Content updates to the [GitHub organisation documentation](./github.md).

Org owners have no authority to make other changes.

### Responsibilities
