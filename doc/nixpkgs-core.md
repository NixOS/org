## Procedures

1. Team decisions are made by unanimous consensus.
2. If no more than a single team member is absent for a decision, and there is unanimous consensus among the rest that the decision is uncontroversial, the absent member is not required to reach consensus.
3. Amendments to these procedures require a team decision, and can never be considered uncontroversial.
